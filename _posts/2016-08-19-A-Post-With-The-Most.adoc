I have been obsessively trying out https://www.staticgen.com/[static site generators] of all different sorts.

They include Hugo, Pelican, Assemble, Middleman, Hexo, Hugo & naturally Jekyll.

Of these, to make a long story short, Hugo and Pelian seem easiest to work with for a poetry majo like myself.

I canot get the Node.js package manager to work properly. Googling for a solution.
