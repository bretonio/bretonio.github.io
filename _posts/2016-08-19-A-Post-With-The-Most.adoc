I have been obsessively trying out https://www.staticgen.com/[static site generators] of all different sorts.

They include [Hugo, [Pelican], [Assemble], Middleman], [Hexo], Hugo & naturally [Jekyll].

Of these, to make a long story short, Hugo and Pelican seem easiest to work with for a poetry major like myself.

I canot get the Node.js package manager to work properly. Googling for a solution.

I should stop now and return to poetry major tasks such as blogging Brazilian politics and culture and writing my modest little media studies column in Portuguese. 

Messing obsessively with the tech is like sharpening your pencil compulsively until you have no time to write because you have to go to the stationery store. 

But still, I love the tech. I have always loved the tech of publishing, from the ancient linotype machine at the South Pasadena Review to the ancient Quark XPress server at Internet World, where I first learned Web publishing on a Cold Fusion system.
