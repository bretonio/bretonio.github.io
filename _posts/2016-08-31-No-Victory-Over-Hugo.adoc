= No Victory Over Hugo

I lied the other day. 

I am now able to push Web sites built with generators like https://neuza-paranhos.github.io/[Hexo] and Pelican to GitHub Pages, but not Hugo. 

I cannot understand it. 

Building https://neuza-paranhos.github.io/2016/08/27/hello-world/[a Hexo site] in the local repo, for example. writes everything to the `public` directory and there is no `index.html` in the root. Unlike https://braytonio.github.io/[Jekyll] which writes it all to root. But eppur se muove.

This is supposed to be the trick to doing the same with a Hugo site, but I cannot get it to work. 

http://philippantar.com/posts/how-i-deploy-to-github-pages/[Some suggest] copying the contents of the `public` folder over to a separate folder, from which you will push.

Others suggest using two branches of the same repository, for source and for output. The logic of it, and those ASCII http://www.textualscholarship.org/stemmatics/[stemmatic diagrams], make me dizzy.

Here is the thing: I have a really nice simplke blog, https://gringolalia.github.io/[My Paraguayan Progress Report], above, with the http://themes.gohugo.io/ghostwriter/[ghostwriter] theme, which I want to use for charting my supposed technical progress instead of HubPress. 

In any case I should not move forward without finally http://readwrite.com/2013/10/02/github-for-beginners-part-2/[educating myself] about `git` and all its mysteries. https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/[This] is pretty basic, for example. 

I guess I am the kind of guy who just jumps right in and does not read the freaking manual until he has developed ulcers googling solutions he does not really grok.

=== Brasilianas of the Day

Here in Brazil, the Senate will start voting on the impeachment charges against President Dilma Rousseff. Ordinarily I would be very interested in following the media blitz surrounding the proceedings on  http://tupiwire.wordpress.com[The New World Lusophone Sousaphone]. I am after all a http://complit.berkeley.edu/[trained and licensed] Barthesian, though not McLuhanite, interpreter of mass culture.

Lately, however, this sort of thing just makes me nervous. 

The coup will be consummated and there is nothing any can doup about it.

https://braytonio.github.io/2016-08-29-der-process/[What mainly impresses one] is how much the Glogo-dominated media has underplayed the story, with the exception of the final day of Rousseff's testimony, covered closely by dozens of international news sources.

The story plays second fiddle today  to coverage of a shooting on a Rio beach involving a Polish tourist, as it played third bassoon the other day to the earthquake in Italy. https://books.google.com.br/books?id=yF2SG8BFDwkC&pg=PA249&lpg=PA249&dq=umberto+eco+media+bias&source=bl&ots=Z1PBhiUW4L&sig=Ct05RJzkaq9sxRK3XffNoumrjXk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiDzYW99OvOAhUMjpAKHULeCqAQ6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&q=umberto%20eco%20media%20bias&f=false[Umberto Eco] (PDF) notes this as one of his ten categories of http://www.mediabias.it/[bias in the Italian media]

The Sambodian subliminal message: «All is Quiet on the Political Front.» 

The interim government is large and in charge and almost certainly not going anywhere -- Globo is already referring to the party of the president as the «opposition» -- so go ahead, foreign investor and make your long-term plans. And yes, we plan to privatize like no tomorrow so get your checkbooks ready! 

=== Huck Finnegan & The Space Case

I would normally be in rehab today but I am doing a Huck Finn number. Again. 

Today being our *rodizio* -- one day a week when you cannot drive from 9 to 5 on the Sambodian streets -- and lacking funds on my **bilhete único* -- a Sambodian Metro Pass -- I resolve to sleep late and then hack GitHub Pages --  I want to make a Pelican site with https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/backdrop[backdrop] --  until our Netflix hour. 

For people of a certain age, we are really into https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Get_Down[The Get Down], which already has a Wikipedia page as extensive as that of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Get_Down[Ramon Llull].

But we are not really so old as that. I remember the mainstreaming of Grandmaster Flash and Kurtis Blow and to a lesser extent  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_Rock:_The_Album[Afrika Baambataa] from freshman in college days, when me and all my friends worked all summer keeping http://kspc.org/[The Space] on the air. 

My DJ namme was Joey Dharma.
