= No Victory Over Hugo

I lied the other day. 

I am now able to push Web sites built generators like https://neuza-paranhos.github.io/[Hexo] and Pelican to GitHub Pages, but not Hugo. 

I cannot understand it. Building a Hexo site in the local repo, for example. writes everything to the `public` directory. 

This is supposed to be the trick to doing the same with a Hugo site, but I cannot get it to work.

I have a nice blog, the Paraguayan Progress Report, with ghostwriter theme, that I want to use for charting my supposed technical progress.

In any case I should not go forward without finally educating myself about `git` and all its mysteries. I am the kind of guy who just jumps right in and does not read the manual until he has developed ulcers googling solutions he does not really grok.
