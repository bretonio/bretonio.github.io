I followed http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/[Dean's instructions] to create a Beautiful Jekyll-themed site at https://braytonio.github.io/[Braytonio.github.io], cloning it into my project `dir` and editing it and its config file with http://prose.io/#Braytonio[Prose.io]. 

No joy.

I commit my changes after editing `aboutme.md` and filling out variables in `config.yml` but the page does not update with its new title, the «Irony Ant Bloc» (an anagram of my name).

I clone the repo to my machine to work on it here but now my jekyll installation makes fubar noises. 

I mess with that for a while and then manage to start building with `bundle exec jekyll build`. But this yields

=== Urgh! (A Music War)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urgh!_A_Music_War[Urgh!]

(I actually attended that groundbreaking event. I even had my picture on the cover of *Surfer* magazine as part of the Dead Boys mosh pit.)

And then I get the e-mail notice of build failure. 

=== Welcome Advice Is Advice That Works

But hooray! There is https://help.github.com/articles/page-build-failed-config-file-error/[advice]. 

I can either check line by line or simple go back to the original `_conf.yml` and re-enter my settings more carefully. I think maybe resetting the `baseurl` to `"/" was the problem. 

And perhaps the problem is not with the Jekyll installation after all. In any event, there are YAML validators to try out, which could be neat.

And so off and so forth. 

=== Neuzinha, Muse of the Digital Arts

Neuza is actually excited at the prospect of me https://github.com/neuza-paranhos/neuza-paranhos.github.io[building her a groovy Web site] where she can publish all her fabulous writings.  

She sometimes refers to herself as «computer widow» because I spend so much time hacking away at digital windmills, so it is nice to have the vote of confidence. 

So I was surprised yesterday when she said she knew what Github was. 

I guess I should not have been: she and Sergio Crusco have been working for a client in the Google Brasil family of fantastically advanced little ventures.  

Em fim: I think I will https://www.notionsandnotes.org/tech/web-development/pelican-static-blog-setup.html[try out Pelican] for this modest domestic project. And now to walk the cadelas.
