https://github.com/HubPress/hubpress.io/blob/master/Writers_Guide.adoc#hp-tags-for-metadata-tags[ASCIIDoc] just makes me angry and confused. I am sorry to say. This is why I intend to adapt one of my GitHub project pages for blogging progress, if any, to my https://github.com/HubPress/hubpress.io/blob/master/Writers_Guide.adoc#hp-tags-for-metadata-tags[GitLab projects]. Abandoning Hubpress, so sorry. It taught me things, valuable things.

I have set my wife up with [a Web log that seems to please her]	. A pretty standard https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/[Clean Blog] theme, but then I am not exactly the Le Corbusier of Web sites. Now we just need an image of our own. Perhaps a stock photo of an old-time https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linotype_machine[linotype machine].
