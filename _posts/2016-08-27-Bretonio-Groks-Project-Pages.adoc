Success. I used a ready-made [Beautiful Jekyll site] to bootstrap my ass into mounting my own personal [GitHub] page.

It has hierarchical pull-down menus like Bootstrap, which I wanted.

Then I successfully followed instructions, like a good kindergartener, to create a project page.

Now to [build Neuza a personal page] -- perhaps with Beautiful Hugo -- and myself a portfolio of project sites using different site generators and themes. 

For hosting portfolios and organizational profile, I am searching for themes and frameworks more akin to portal CMSes, with blogging playing second fiddle.

Big deal, you might say, but for me it was all a stroke of enlightening.
