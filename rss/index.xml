<div class="paragraph">
<p>I followed <a href="http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/">Dean&#8217;s instructions</a> to create a Beautiful Jekyll-themed site at <a href="https://braytonio.github.io/">Braytonio.github.io</a>, cloning it into my project <code>dir</code> and editing it and its config file with <a href="http://prose.io/#Braytonio">Prose.io</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No joy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I commit my changes after editing <code>aboutme.md</code> and filling out variables in <code>config.yml</code> but the page does not update with its new title, the «Irony Ant Bloc» (an anagram of my name).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I clone the repo to my machine to work on it here but now my jekyll installation makes fubar noises.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I mess with that for a while and then manage to start building with <code>bundle exec jekyll build</code>. But this yields</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&gt;&gt; control characters are not allowed at line 1, column 1</p>

<div class="paragraph">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(I actually attended that groundbreaking event. I even had my picture on the cover of <strong>Surfer</strong> magazine as part of the Dead Boys mosh pit.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And then I get the e-mail notice of build failure.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_welcome_advice_is_advice_that_works">Welcome Advice Is Advice That Works</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But hooray! There is <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/page-build-failed-config-file-error/">advice</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I can either check line by line or simple go back to the original <code>_conf.yml</code> and re-enter my settings more carefully. I think maybe resetting the <code>baseurl</code> to `"/" was the problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And perhaps the problem is not with the Jekyll installation after all. In any event, there are YAML validators to try out, which could be neat.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And so off and so forth.</p>

<h3 id="_neuzinha_muse_of_the_digital_arts">Neuzinha, Muse of the Digital Arts</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Neuza is actually excited at the prospect of me <a href="https://github.com/neuza-paranhos/neuza-paranhos.github.io">building her a groovy Web site</a> where she can publish all her fabulous writings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She sometimes refers to herself as «computer widow» because I spend so much time hacking away at digital windmills, so it is nice to have the vote of confidence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So I was surprised yesterday when she said she knew what Github was.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I guess I should not have been: she and Sergio Crusco have been working for a client in the Google Brasil family of fantastically advanced little ventures.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Em fim: I think I will <a href="https://www.notionsandnotes.org/tech/web-development/pelican-static-blog-setup.html">try out Pelican</a> for this modest domestic project. And now to walk the cadelas.</p>

<p>I hate this machine, an antiquated Windows 7 box in the computer lab at the Cancer Ward. (I have AMPPS installed as a localhost server for testing CMS but it is pretty damn <code>fubar</code>.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For one thing, the permissions will not let me install Python or Node.js, although they are fine with Ruby.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tech support? There are rumors that it atually exists, but no sign of intelligent life yet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So I cannot work in my down time here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Windows command line interface is also a pain in the ass.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No <code>unzip</code> command, and the <code>edit</code> command gives you an editor which does not follow your keymap&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;no freaking double quotes, which one needs for front matter and any number of things.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So it looks like I will be stuck working with <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/static_website_generation">Ruby sitegens</a> during the week: Jekyll &amp; <a href="http://nanoc.ws/doc/tutorial/">Nanoc</a> &amp; <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/projects/awestruct">Awestruct</a> &#8230;&#8203; should be fun.</p>

<p>You know what might be perfect for the projects I am planning?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="http://blog.kdheepak.com/how-to-set-up-a-pelican-blog-with-github-pages.html">Pelican</a> with a theme called <a href="https://github.com/yuex/pelican-chameleon">Chameleon</a> which is translatable into various [Bootstrap]-based themes, like <a href="https://bootswatch.com/united/">United</a>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;an homage to Ubuntu&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;or <a href="https://bootswatch.com/cosmo/">Cosmos</a>. Cosmos I really like.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="http://blog.kdheepak.com/how-to-set-up-a-pelican-blog-with-github-pages.html">Pelican Bootstrap3</a> has the same flexibility.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But I do not understand how to reset the variables in these themes as instructed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It appears you have to replace THEME = in <strong>pelicanconf.py</strong> with BOOTSTRAP_THEME = &#8230;&#8203; Or do you?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No, I see now, you first refer to THEME = 'pelican-bootstrap3' and then add the other line below it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And it works!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This may not seem like much of a technical triumph to you but I majored in poetry, as I often say. (I practically have a piled higher and deeper in advanced literary thinkology).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am down to <a href="http://themes.gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> and <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/install.html">Pelican</a> and <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/content.html">Jekyll</a> for my site-builder of choice. Jekyll is kind of hard to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://getnikola.com/getting-started.html">Nikola</a>, maintained in the AUR repository, is also interesting&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;<code>yaourt python-nikola-git</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But it uses reStructuredText, of which am not at all fond. Start talking about recompiling and my eyes glaze over.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Are there other such tools in AUR? Jekyll for one is. Ruby Toolbox has a whole section on them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The time comes when you have to choose and get on with things.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to know the truth, I am probably going to use a simple CMS for these projects because the authors will want the satisfaction of learning to manage their <strong>conteúdo</strong> themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(It is a learning exercise for patients of the Cancer Ward.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But Mrs. Me is calling. Time for a late lunch of arroz, feijão e salada, and «Brasileirinho» playing on Radio USP.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have been obsessively trying out <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">static site generators</a> of all different sorts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They include <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-hugo-a-static-site-generator-on-ubuntu-14-04">Hugo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes">Pelican</a>, <a href="http://www.andismith.com/blog/2014/02/getting-started-with-assemble/">Assemble</a>, <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a>, <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">Hexo</a>, &amp; naturally <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of these, to make a long story short, Hugo and Pelican seem easiest to work with for a poetry major like myself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An obstacle in my quest for encyclopedic testing of these systems: I cannot get the Node.js package manager to work properly. This means I am unable to check out, for example, <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby">Gatsby</a> for the time being. Or [Sculpin] or [Assemble] or <a href="http://www.metalsmith.io/">Metalsmith</a> or <a href="https://harpjs.com/docs/quick-start">Harp</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Googling for a solution. Cactus and other Python packages are accessible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the meantime I added quickstart crib sheets on Pelican and Hugo to my DokuWiki.</p>
</div>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I should stop now and return to poetry major tasks such as blogging Brazilian &amp; Sambodian&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;São Paulo&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;politics and culture and writing my modest little mediahttp://bootswatch.com/flatly/ studies column in Portuguese.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I should also select a package and begin working on two sites I am pledged to develop for the Cancer Ward and its denizens. I actually think that <a href="http://urubu-quickstart.jandecaluwe.com/start.html">Urubu</a> would work very nicely with the <a href="http://bootswatch.com/flatly/#buttons">Flatly theme</a>, the same used by Typesetter, which however lacks a decent blogging module.</p>

<h2 id="_sharpening_the_pencil">Sharpening the Pencil</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Messing obsessively with the tech is like sharpening your pencil compulsively until you have no time to write because you have to go to the stationery store. Again. Formulating the To-Do list on my wiki becomes an end in itself. Writing projects are endlessly deferred until the wiki becomes an exercise i the possibility of writing and not writing in itself. In the same vein as Jorge Luis Borges, I guess.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But still, I love the tech with a passion and refuse to let my chronic newbism get in the way of hacking the CMS or sitegen.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="_verborrhea_typophilia">Verborrhea &amp; Typophilia</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have always loved the tech of publishing, from the ancient linotype machine at the South Pasadena Review to the ancient Quark XPress server at Internet World, where I first learned Web publishing on a Cold Fusion system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In junior high school print shop, we made fliers and business cards the same way Gutenberg made Bibles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In graduate school at Berkeley I did a fantastic paleography seminar with Prof. Joseph Duggan. I did a project on a medieval Iberian author who tried to institute quality control against the constant slips of the pen of half-blind monks&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;hence <a href="http://www.textualscholarship.org/stemmatics/">Lachmann&#8217;s method</a>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;by maintaining true copies of his works at various locations and mentioning them in the preface to his work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Copying books by hand was an exercise in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers">Chinese Whispers</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I was so inspired by this course that I considered dropping my doctorate and doing a master&#8217;s in library science&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;a very advanced and challenging field when practiced correctly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In any event, I love typography and layout and writing heds and subheds and jump heds. What I would not give to be back on the New York editorial scene working for Jane or GQ or Artforum as in the rapidly receding past.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>But it would not stop.</p>

<p>I promised a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beco_do_Batman">Sambodian</a> psychoanalyst acquaintance of mine I would <strong>dar um jeito</strong> with his <a href="http://www.luizfernandofontesteixeira.com.br">Web site</a>￼.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="http://whatcms.org/?s=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.luizfernandofontesteixeira.com.br&amp;na=&amp;nb=bf0d6b0cd6&amp;nc=a283d9370b39da2dc4bac2aabadcb296">What CMS</a> says he is likely using <a href="https://www.wix.com/support/html5/article/request-cms-system">Wix</a> for his current site.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>«Stunning». Everything is «stunning» with those Wix people.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>«Your stunning blog».</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Set all Web design phasers on «stun».</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The thing is that Doctor Jungfraud writes and posts a lot of dated articles for newspapers and journals but he is not technically inclined. His Wix site basically works but is ugly as sin.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He says he wants to learn a bit more about managing his own content but finds those Big 5 CMS software packages hard to use. Something like Grav might be useful. You can date your content at will, for example.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And who does not?
<a href="http://tiki.org/tiki-index.php">TikiWiki</a> drives me crazy for example. But there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_content_management_systems">so many choices</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately, the sort of drag and drop layout manager and WYSIWYG text editor offered by an in many ways admirable project like <a href="http://sambodianas.typesetter.com">Typesetter</a> is not really going to be that much easier for Zé Psychology Major. As <a href="https://learn.getgrav.org/content/markdown">they say</a></p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Typesetter is sort of the Quark Express of CMS. And Quark is the 1958 Chevy Impala of offline words into typography-on-paper machines.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So maybe Doctor Strangelove will just have to hire me&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;dirt cheap&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;to manage his <strong>conteúdo</strong> for him.</p>
